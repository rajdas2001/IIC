						<h3>All condition charger</h3>
						<p>Conversion of mechanical energy to electrical energy to be used to charge the phone. .This system consists of the CPU fan and neodymium magnets USB module boost and a USB cord and a base platform to place the fan and the USB module on it . 3.The idea is to place single neodymium magnets on each blade of the CPU fan and stick them to the blade base .Then the two wires of it are soldered into the USB module boost's terminals . l. Then the USB cord is connected to the USB port and then other set of neodymium magnets is placed in a stand placed very close to the blades and then the other set of magnets is held in the stand .Thus due to continuous attractions and repulsion between consecutive magnets causes the fan blades to rotate thereby generating rotational kinetic energy which is converted into electrical energy at the USB port and thus the phone is charged .</p>

						<h3>Smart water treatment</h3>
						<p>Kitchen waste water can be treated with a simple oil and grease trap and a planted filter for reuse as garden water. The first thing to do is to trap the oil and grease which can be taken out occasionally and put into a compost heap. The food material is also allowed to settle down and separated from the rest of the water . By applying screening we can remove the other particles present in the water. Other process added to it is sedimentation , oil separator etc . , This remaining water is oxygenated using a small aquarium bubbler. It also consumes less than a half unit of energy every day. About 100 litres to 120 litres of water can be treated and used to water the pots and the garden.</p>

If there occurs some changes then the system will send an alert message to the company with the location of the fuel tank. The system also alarms at that moment with a buzzer. The system will be unlocked with both the RF Id card and the password. The card should be with the driver and the password with the dealer.</p>

						<h3>Iris Authenticator</h3>
						<p>Universal Authentication is a method for verifying the identity of users on a specific website without asking for the same identification every time the user moves from one site to the other. The user need not to input his/her security details again every time a new mode is encountered. To enter into the sites the only thing to do is just scan your iris with your camera. It takes the required data like the intricate structure of your iris and stores it in the database and when you want to access your account the second time, it just searches for the required match if found it gives access.</p>

						<h3>Inspection Optimizer</h3>
						<p>Nowadays Inspection is a clamorous activity to ensure customer satisfaction. But that is processed manually and rely on the judgmental experience of the experts. It gives less accuracy and requires extra manpower. To overcome this we are here with an idea which can give the extremely satisfactory result on inspection with the help of Artifical intelligence and image processing. It requires less manpower and time.</p>

						<h3>Fuel Defender</h3>
						<p>Generally oil carrying tanks in India are defenseless and security less which means there is a high probability of oil robbery. Here we are trying to enhance the security of the adding some features which consists of 3 things

(i) pressure and weight measuring device,

(ii)security pass code system which can be changed according to time and

(iii) alarming system. With the password the tank can't be opened and if any other measures taken there will be a pressure and weight variance which will activate the alarming system. The alarming system will inform both sender and receiver side as well as the police. So the security system has 2 step verification Which won't allow any robbery to take place.</p>

						<h3>RO water purifier</h3>
						<p>In the RO process there is a lot of wastewater but in our model, we are trying to minimise the waste by using both osmosis and the reverse osmosis process. Here first the supply water( mainly tap water) undergoes RO and we get pure water. Then the wastewater goes under osmosis with the charcoal treated tap water resulting in a decrease in impurity concentration of the wastewater. After this water undergoes RO with pure water to obtain pure water. And again the wastewater undergoes the previously mentioned cyclic process which causes the zero wastage of water.</p>

						<h3>Portable Soil Monitoring System</h3>
						<p>The project will benefit farmers by letting them knowing the amount of minerals present in the soil. As now-a-days farmers don’t know what is the composition of minerals in their soil they put fertilizers in a haphazard manner. So we use the spectroscopy technology to know the composition of minerals present in the soil thus allowing them use fertilizers in a well planned manner that will enhance the quality of soil. We made a sample solution of soil to be tested, and then we placed it in between two convex lenses. The source of light ray is an LED bulb that illuminates and thus producing light rays. The light rays after passing through the convex lens converges at other end, i.e. at camera thus allowing to know the intensity and hence composition of minerals.</p>
